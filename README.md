## [YouTube Pause With Spacebar]()

Slap the spacebar, pause the video. Like you'd expect. Based on [YouTube Pause](http://goo.gl/6ExxFO) but fixes the issue with pausing while trying to type in the comments and search.

## Where Do I Get It?

Grab it from the [Chrome Store]().

## What Does It Do?

Unless focus has been placed in the video player, YouTube scrolls down the page instead of pausing the video when you hit spacebar. This Chrome extension prevents that default behavior and using the spacebar will pause or play the video
